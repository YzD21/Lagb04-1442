				<p> 	
					Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a 
					document written in a markup language such as HTML.CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
					CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.This separation can improve content accessibility, 
					provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .

					CSS has various levels and profiles. Each level of CSS builds upon the last, typically adding new features and typically denoted as CSS 1, CSS 2, CSS 3, and CSS 4.
					Profiles are typically a subset of one or more levels of CSS built for a particular device or user interface. Currently there are profiles for mobile devices, printers, and television sets.
					Profiles should not be confused with media types, which were added in CSS 2.The first CSS specification to become an official W3C Recommendation is CSS level 1, published on December 17, 1996. 
					HÃ¥kon Wium Lie and Bert Bos are credited as the original developers. CSS level 2 specification was developed by the W3C and published as a recommendation in May 1998. 
					A superset of CSS 1, CSS 2 includes a number of new capabilities like absolute, relative, and fixed positioning of elements and z-index, the concept of media types, support for aural style sheets (which were later replaced by the CSS 3 speech modules)[44] and bidirectional text,
					SS level 2 revision 1, often referred to as "CSS 2.1", fixes errors in CSS 2, removes poorly supported or not fully interoperable features and adds already implemented browser extensions to the specification. To comply with the W3C Process for standardizing technical specifications,
					CSS 2.1 went back and forth between Working Draft status and Candidate Recommendation status for many years. Unlike CSS 2, which is a large single specification defining various features, CSS 3 is divided into several separate documents called "modules".
					Each module adds new capabilities or extends features defined in CSS 2, preserving backward compatibility. Work on CSS level 3 started around the time of publication of the original CSS 2 recommendation. The earliest CSS 3 drafts were published in June 1999.

				<p>
					Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
					Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
					HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. 
					HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. 
					Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
